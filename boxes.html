					My name is Nidhi. I am a Technical Specialist. I have a keen interest in designing and picturing. I am fond of taking photographs from daily life. For example, I was standing on a bus stop waiting for the bus. It was a nice warm day, unlike others I found this Church full of positive energy, so I took a picture of it. Since then, it is my cover image of my Facebook profile, my mobile phone wallpaper and now an expression of me.
